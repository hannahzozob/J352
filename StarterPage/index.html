<h2><strong>Scroll through to remember five iconic 10's music, shows and fashion.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong> Boy Bands </strong></h3>
	<p> When I say I know my Big 3, I'm not talking about my sun, moon and rising astrological signs. I'm talking about these Big 3: One Direction, Big Time Rush and The Jonas Brothers. Yes, this was the era of the directioners and Disney shows about pop boy bands (*cough cough* BOTH Big Time Rush and The Jonas Brothers)  </p>
<p>.</p>

<h3> <strong>Silly Bandz </strong></h3>


<p>Rubber bands that took the form of an animal or fun objects? Innovation. That's all.

<h3><strong>"Keep Calm and Carry On" </strong></h3>
	<p> The one line that single-handedly swept the early 2010's internet off its feet, printing itself on nearly all of the school fair bookmarks and making an appearance on every poorly-edited social media posts. For some reason, it was everwhere. There was no escaping it.

<h3> <strong> Converse, Heelys, Uggs Boots</strong> </h3>
	<p> These were the "it" shoes and the "it" look: the black and white Converse look, to the quirky Heelys trend, to the brown Uggs Boots in the fall and winter (with how popular these were, maybe even all-year round).

<h3><strong> Disney Channel</strong> </h3>
<p class="paragraph1"> 2000's to early 2010's Disney Channel: this was hands-down the best Disney Channel era. First of all, the triple-show crossover episodes were just too good. Let's also not forget the iconic mini series that played during the commercials, like "Pass the Plate" and "The Time I...," and when actors had to draw the Disney logo with some sort of glowing wand onto the bottom left of our screens. </p>
