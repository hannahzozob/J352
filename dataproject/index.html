<h1>Navient Corporation Lawsuit: Does the High Volume of Filed Complaints per State Correlate with Average College Tuition Costs?</h1>
<h2><em>By Hannah Zozobrado</em></h2>


<p>In 2017, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/" target="_blank">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> took legal action against <a href="https://navient.com/" target="_blank"> Navient Corporation</a>, a federal student loan servicer, which has since accrued a multitude of filed complaints nationwide from its loan borrowers.</p>

<p>The number of complaints in some states exceed that of others — from mid-2020 to present, the three states that have produced the most complaints per 1000 population are Georgia, Delaware and Florida. </p>

<p>According to a New York Times article <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/26/us/college-student-migration.html#:~:text=Alaska%20sends%20out%20more%20students,most%20students%2C%20with%2034%20entering." target="_blank"> “The Great Out-of-State Migration: Where Students Go</a>,” Delaware public colleges took in a total of 3,339 out-of-state students in 2016, comparable to the 830 Delaware residents that left to attend college elsewhere in that same academic year. Georgia and Florida, on the other hand, had more residents leave for other states than students come for public college.</p>

<p>Since 2016, the student diaspora may have since shifted and the provided information and statistics may be obsolete. However, the article inspires the possibility that the volume of incoming out-of-state students may be a potential reason behind the high number of filed complaints, given that out-of-state tuition is more costly and is more likely to result in  <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com" target="_blank">student loans.</a></p>
